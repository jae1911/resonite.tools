# Modding

Modding is a very useful tool in Resonite.

It can allow to add features or patches for certain annoying bugs.

Modding is allowed as long as it doesn't breaks the [guidelines](https://resonite.com/policies/).

It is to be noted that MonkeyLoader does provide some degree of compatibility with RML mods.
